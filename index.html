            <h1 id=chet>Chet Faker</h1>
            
            
            <p>Nicholas "Nick" James Murphy (born 23 June 1988), better known by his former stage name Chet Faker, is an Australian singer and songwriter. In 2012, he issued an extended play, Thinking in Textures and signed to Downtown Records in the United States. In October 2012, he won Breakthrough Artist of the Year and Thinking in Textures won Best Independent Single/EP at the Australian Independent Records Awards.</p>
            <p>In January 2013, the work won Best Independent Release at the Rolling Stone Australia Awards for 2012. His cover of Blackstreet's "No Diggity" was featured in a 2013 Super Bowl commercial for Beck's Sapphire. In April 2014, Built on Glass, Faker's debut studio album, was released to generally positive reviews and debuted at number one on the Australian ARIA Charts. Three songs from the album were subsequently voted into the top ten of Triple J's Hottest 100 of 2014, including the number one spot for "Talk Is Cheap".</p>

            <p>Murphy decided to play under a stage name after people came to his shows thinking he was a different and already established musician named Nick Murphy. He settled on the name Chet Faker as an homage to Chet Baker: "I listened to a lot of jazz and I was a big fan of ... the way he sang, when he moved into mainstream singing. He had this really fragile vocal style—this really, broken, close-up and intimate style. The name is kind of just an ode to Chet Baker and the mood of music he used to play—something I would like to at least pay homage to in my own music." Other influences he has cited include Bob Dylan, as well as his mother's Motown albums and his father's "chilled out Ibiza CDs".</p>

He first rose to prominence after his cover of Blackstreet's "No Diggity" went viral online, reaching number one on the Hypemachine chart in May 2011. He released his first EP, Thinking in Textures, on 22 March 2012 to positive reviews, being described as "wonderfully loungey" and praised for its ability to "mix subtlety with impressive beauty". The EP was also popular with fans, with its second single, "I'm Into You", landing at number 24 on radio station Triple J's Hottest 100 of 2012.</p>
<p>
Faker has worked with several other artists since the release of his debut EP, including collaborations with Flume and remixes of songs by MS MR and The Temper Trap. He was a featured vocalist on Say Lou Lou's "Fool of Me", which was named Best New Track by Pitchfork in May 2013.</p>

On Thursday September 8, Faker announced on Twitter that his next record would be released under his birth name Nick Murphy.

There's an evolution happening and I wanted to let you know where its going. The next record will be under my own name, Nick Murphy. Chet Faker will always be a part of the music.
